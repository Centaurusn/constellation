# Constellation Catalog of Repositories

A list of Constellation repositories are given below. These repositories depend 
on Constellation, also called "Core" which can be treated like a framework you 
develop functionality on top. Functionality that is domain agnostic should be 
in Core but anything else should live in its own module which is in its own 
repository.

We are excited to find out what the community will do with Constellation!
